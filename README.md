│                      
└── root/
    ├── home/                # User home directories
    │   └── [user1]/         # Your user directory will automatically be created upon user creation
    │
    ├── tmp/                 # Temporary files
    │
    ├── src/                 # Source code for the OS
    │   ├── shell.py
    │   ├── commands.py
    │   ├── user_management.py
    │   └── login.py
    │
    |
    ├── config/              # System configuration files
    | 
    ├── logs/                # Logs generated by the OS
    │
    └── misc/                # Miscellaneous application data and system hashes
        └── hashes/          # Directory for user data hashes
        └── libraries/       # Directory for python libraries downloaded when using pip
        └── pad/             # Directory for Pad - FilOS' Text Editor
